# Copifi

One feature I love about macOS and iOS is its ability to synchronise the clipboard between devices. The issue I faced was that my macOS clipboard and Windows clipboard couldn't sync in the same way. The solutions out there I felt were overly complex, so I have built one that simply uses a pythons command line interface and sockets.
